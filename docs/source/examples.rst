You can find here sample notebooks which show the usage of varius feature of the library in a production like experiment and setup.

1. Classification example: a classification experiment based on distiller classifier layer, with MobilenetV3Plus minimalistic feature extractor backbone.
2. Segmentation example: a segmentation experiment based on DeepLabv3+ segmentation decoder with MobilenetV3Plus minimalistic encoder.
3. Model User Guide. A notebook with documentation about the different possible models provided by this library
